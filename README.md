### Hi there
I am a Research Council of Finland postdoctoral research at Aalto University working on probabilistic machine learning.

My research interest are on computational approaches to probabilistic modeling/reasoning, uncertainty quantification, and Bayesian statistics. I am actively involved in several research communities, such as, tractable probabilistic modeling (e.g., probabilistic circuits), probabilistic programming (e.g., Turing.jl), and Bayesian deep learning.

For details, see my [website](https://trappmartin.github.io) and my [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GwCrZP4AAAAJ&hl=en) profile.
