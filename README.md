### Hi there
I’m a machine learning researcher working on probabilistic models that exploit structural properties (e.g., symmetries or decomposability) to allow efficient and exact computations while maintaining the capability to express complex relationships in data. Most of my work focuses on the intersection of probabilistic circuits, Bayesian nonparametrics and deep learning. For details, see my [website](https://trappmartin.github.io) and my [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GwCrZP4AAAAJ&hl=en) profile.

In addition to my research on probabilistic models, I’m part of the open-source project [Turing.jl](https://turing.ml).
