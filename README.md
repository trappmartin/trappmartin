### Hi there
I am a Research Council of Finland postdoctoral research at Aalto University working on probabilistic machine learning.

Most of my open-source activities are centred around probabilistic modeling, uncertainty quantification, and deep learning. 
I am actively involved in several research communities.

For details, see my [website](https://trappmartin.github.io) and my [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GwCrZP4AAAAJ&hl=en) profile.
